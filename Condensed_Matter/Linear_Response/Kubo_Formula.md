# Kubo Formula

Reference: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubo_formula)

Consider a quantum system described by the (time independent) Hamiltonian $H_0$. Suppose now that an external perturbation $V(t)$ is applied very slowly, or suddenly turned on at some time $t_0$:

$$
H(t) = H_0 + V(t)
$$ 

Before turning on the perturbation, the ensemble average of a quantity $A$ is given by (working in the Heisenberg picture)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \expect{A}_0 &= \tr \rho_0 A 
    \qquad \left(
        \rho_0 = \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-\beta H_0}
    \right)
    \\
    &= \frac{1}{Z_0} \sum_n e^{-\beta E_n}
    \amp{n}{A}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\ket{n}$ are eigenstates of $H_0$ with energies $E_n$. Here we have used $\amp{n}{A_H(t)}{n}$ as $\amp{n}{A}{n}$ when $H = H_0$, where $A$ is in Schr√∂dinger picture. 

After turning on the perturbation, we assume that the system is weakly coupled to the heat bath (i.e. it will reach new equilibrium very slowly), so that the ensemble average is still performed with respect to the old distribution; but the values $\amp{n}{A}{n}$ will be replaced:

$$
\expect{A}(t) = \frac{1}{Z_0} 
\sum_n e^{-\beta E_n} \amp{n}{A_H(t)}{n}
$$

where $A_H(t)$ is the operator in the full Heisenberg picture. It can be related to the interaction picture $A_I(t)$ by (setting the reference time to $-\infty$, when there is still no perturbation)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_H(t) &= U_I^\dagger(t,-\infty) A_I(t) U_I(t,-\infty)
    \\
    &\simeq \left[
        1 + \frac{i}{\hbar} 
        \int_{-\infty}^t dt' \, V_I(t')
    \right] A_I(t) \left[
        1 - \frac{i}{\hbar} 
        \int_{-\infty}^t dt' \, V_I(t')
    \right]
    \\
    &\simeq A_I(t) - \frac{i}{\hbar} 
    \int_{-\infty}^t dt' \, [A_I(t), V_I(t')]
\end{aligned}
$$

Here we keep terms up to first order in $V_I$. But we know that

$$
\amp{n}{A_I(t)}{n} = \amp{n}{A}{n}
$$

therefore

$$
\amp{n}{A_H(t)}{n}
= \amp{n}{A}{n}
- \frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{-\infty}^t dt' \, 
\amp{n}{[A_I(t), V_I(t')]}{n}
$$

Now we can obtain the new expectation value of $A$ at time $t$:

<div class="result">

**Kubo formula:**

$$
\expect{A}(t) = \expect{A}_0
- \frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{-\infty}^t dt' \, 
\expect{[A_I(t), V_I(t')]}_0
$$

</div><br>

## Response Functions

Usually one assumes that the perturbation has the following form

$$
V(t) = B f(t)
$$

where $f(t)$ is a *c*-number function *coupled* to the operator $B$. 

<div class="remark">

*Remark*: One common example of $B f(t)$ is $\int d^3x \, \rho(\mathbf{x}) E(t)$, where $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ is the charge density operator, and $E(t)$ is the electric field. 

</div><br>

Then we can rewrite Kubo formula as

$$
\expect{A}(t) = \expect{A}_0
- \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dt' \, 
\chi^R_{AB}(t - t') f(t')
$$

(note that we have changed the upper limit of $t'$ to $+\infty$) with the following definition:

<div class="result">

**Retarded response function (Green's function):**

$$
\chi^R_{AB}(t - t') \equiv
- \frac{i}{\hbar} 
\expect{[A_I(t), B_I(t')]}_0 \theta(t - t')
$$

</div><br>

The time-independence of $H_0$ ensures that $\chi$ depends only on the difference between $t$ and $t'$.  The introduction of $\theta(t - t')$ in $\chi^R$ means that the response (change of $\expect{A}$) only depends on perturbation from the past.
