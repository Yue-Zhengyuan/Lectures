# Theory of Finite Groups

### **Part 1: Basic Definitions**

## Group Axioms

- **Order of a group element $g$**: the minimal positive integer $N$ satisfying 
    
    $$
    g^N = 1 \quad (\text{Abelian: } N g = 0)
    $$

- **Abelian group**: A group in which *all elements commute*.

Whenever we use the additive notation, we have assumed that we are dealing with an Abelian group. 

## Homomorphism and Isomorphism

*Definition*: Let $G_1, G_2$ be two groups

- **Homomorphism (同态)**: a map $f: G_1 \to G_2$ such that

    $$
    \forall x, y \in G_1 \quad \begin{aligned}
        &f(xy)  = f(x) f(y)     & \text{(General)}\\
        &f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)   & \text{(Abelian)}
    \end{aligned} 
    $$

    - **Isomorphism (同构)**: an homomorphism from one group to another which is *also injective (one-to-one)*.

    - **Isomorphic Groups**: Two groups between which exists an isomorphism, denoted by

        $$
        G_1 \cong G_2
        $$

## Subgroups and Cosets

*Definition*:

- **Subgroups**: a subset $H$ of $G$ which still forms a group under the same multiplication rule of $G$
    
    - **Normal (invariant) subgroup**: a subgroup $H \in G$ which is invariant under *conjugation* by any elements in $G$:

        $$
        (H \triangleleft G) :=
        \forall \, h \in H, g \in G :
        g^{-1} h g \in H
        $$

- **Coset**: The set of group elements obtained by multiplying $g \in G$ on the left (or right) of a subgroup $H$ of $G$

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Left coset} &: gH = \{gh \mid h \in H\}
        \\
        \text{Right coset}&: Hg = \{hg \mid h \in H\}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

*Theorem*: (**Group homomorphism lemma**)

Let $f: G_1 \to G_2$ be a group homomorphism. Then

- $\ker{f} = \{x|x\in G_1, f(x) = 0\}$ is a subgroup of $G_1$
- $\text{im }f = \{y|y \in f(G_1) \subset G_2\}$ is a subgroup of $G_2$

*Theorem*: (**Coset decomposition of any group**)

## Equivalence and Quotient Group

Let $G$ be a group; $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. 

- **Equivalence relation**: Two elements $g, g' \in G$ are **equivalent** if 
    
    $$
    \exist h \in H: g' = gh 
    \quad (\text{i.e.} \quad g^{-1} g' \in H)
    $$
    
    Since $H$ is also a group, this is also equivalent to saying $g' g^{-1} \in H$. 
    
    In Abelian notation

    $$
    g' - g \in H
    $$

- **Equivalence class $[g]$**: the set of all elements in $G$ that are equivalent to $g$
    
    $$
    [g] = \{gh \mid h \in H\}
    $$

    which is just the *left coset* $gH$. 
    
- **The quotient group $G/H$**: when $H$ is a *normal* subgroup of $G$, *the set of all equivalence classes* (left cosets of $H$) will become a new group called the **quotient group**:

    $$
    G/H = \{ [g] \mid g \in G\}
    $$

    The multiplication is defined as

    $$
    [g] [g'] = [g g']
    $$

    *Verification of unambiguity*:

    Since $g^{-1} H g = H$, we obtain

    $$
    [g][g'] = (g H) (g' H)
    = g g' (g'^{-1} H g') H 
    = g g' H = [g g']
    $$

*Theorem*: (**Fundamental theorem of homomorphism**)

Let $f: G_1 \to G_2$ be a group homomorphism. Then

$$G_1 / \ker{f} \cong \text{im }f$$
