## Central Charge

The general form of the OPE is

$$
T(z)T(w) 
= \frac{c/2}{(z-w)^4} + \frac{2T(w)}{(z-w)^2}
+ \frac{\partial T(w)}{z-w} + \text{reg.}
$$

The model-dependent constant number $c$ is called the **central charge**.

### Physical Meaning of The Central Charge

Consider a map from the complex plane to c *cylinder* of circumference $L$:

$$
z \to w = \frac{2\pi}{L} \ln z
$$
