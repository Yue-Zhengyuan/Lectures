## Conformal Families

The set consisting of a *primary field* $\phi$ and *all of its descendants* is called a **conformal family**, sometimes denoted by $[\phi]$. The members of a family *transform amongst themselves under conformal transformations*.

### OPE of $T(z)$ with Descendant Fields

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &T(z) \phi^{(-n)}(w)
    \\
    &= \frac{c n (n^2-1) / 12}{(z-w)^{n+2}} \phi(w)
    + \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{n+k}{(z-w)^{k+2}}\phi^{(k-n)}(w)
    \\ &\quad
    + \sum_{k \ge 0} (z-w)^{k-2} \phi^{(-k,-n)}(w)
\end{aligned}
$$

*Special case*: For $n = 1 \, (\phi^{(-1)} = \partial \phi)$

$$
T(z) \partial \phi(w)
= \frac{2h \phi(w)}{(z-w)^3}
+ \frac{(h+1)\partial \phi(w)}{(z-w)^2}
+ \frac{\partial^2 \phi(w)}{z-w} + \text{reg.}
$$

Recall that for free boson

$$
T(z) \partial\phi(w) 
= \frac{\partial \phi(w)}{(z-w)^2}
+ \frac{\partial^2 \phi(w)}{z-w}
$$
