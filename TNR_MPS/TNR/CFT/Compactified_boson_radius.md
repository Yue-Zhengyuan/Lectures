## Radius of Compactified Boson

According to [Phys. Rev. E **101**, 060105(R)](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.060105), the *compactification radius* $R$ of the compactified Boson CFT is equal to the **Klein bottle ratio** $g$, defined by

$$
g \equiv \frac{Z^K(2L_x, L_y/2)}{Z^T(L_x, L_y)}
$$

where $Z^K$ is the partition function on Klein bottle, and $Z^T$ is the partition function on torus.

In the TNR algorithm, after $N$ steps of RG, a tensor representing only a small portion of the partition function now represents the partition function itself for $2^N$ times the original size.
