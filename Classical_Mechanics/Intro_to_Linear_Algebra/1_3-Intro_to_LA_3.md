## Things Omitted in This Introduction

Here I list some topics that are important but will not be needed in this course, some of which are covered in the *Essence of Linear Algebra* series:

- **Cramer's rule** of solving linear equations ([Episode 12](https://youtu.be/jBsC34PxzoM) of *Essence of Linear Algebra* gives a *very beautiful* proof of it, using the geometric meaning of determinants) 

- **Singular value decomposition** of matrices
