*(We shall not consider the complicated case where the direction of rotation axis changes with time. An example is [**precession**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession).)*

In most introductory courses on classical mechanics, the teachers simply tell students the following "facts":

- For a point rotating around a *fixed* axis (rotation angle =
$\alpha (t)$), the **angular velocity** $\boldsymbol{\omega}(t)$ is a *vector* of

    - Magnitude: $\omega(t) = d\alpha (t)/dt$
    
    - Direction: Parallel to the axis of rotation, determined by some "**right-hand rule**"

- With the above definition of $\boldsymbol{\omega}$, The linear velocity $\boldsymbol{v}(t)$ of the point can be found by some *mysterious* operation called the **cross product**, defined by

    $$
    \boldsymbol{v}
    = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}
    =\det \begin{bmatrix}
        e_x & \omega_1 & r_1 \\
        e_y & \omega_2 & r_2 \\
        e_z & \omega_3 & r_3
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        \omega_2 r_3 - \omega_3 r_2 \\
        \omega_3 r_1 - \omega_1 r_3 \\
        \omega_1 r_2 - \omega_2 r_1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$


To really understand how people "invented" the angular velocity vector and cross product, you must use the correct mathematical language to describe rotations. You know that rotations are *linear transformations*, so we should speak in terms of matrices and vectors.

After going through this material, the *most important* (and maybe surprising to you, or any starters) thing you should remember is:

## Matrix Representation of Rotations

### Rotation Around the Coordinate Axes

<center>

![](Figures/z_rotation.svg)   
*Rotation around the $z$-axis by angle $\alpha$*

</center>

The matrix of rotation by an angle $\alpha$ ($\alpha >0$ for counter-clockwise rotations) around the $z$-axis (under the standard basis) is

$$
R_z(\alpha)
= \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos  \alpha  & -\sin  \alpha  & 0 \\
    \sin  \alpha  & \cos  \alpha  & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

You can easily derive it by the meaning of the columns of a transformation matrix. 

Similarly, you can show that the rotation matrix around $x$-axis and $y$-axis (under the standard basis) are, respectively

$$
R_x(\alpha) 
= \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \cos  \alpha  & -\sin  \alpha  \\
    0 & \sin  \alpha  & \cos  \alpha
\end{bmatrix}
, \,
R_y(\alpha)
= \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos  \alpha  & 0 & \sin  \alpha  \\
    0 & 1 & 0 \\
    -\sin  \alpha  & 0 & \cos  \alpha
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Matrix for Arbitrary 3D Rotations

Every rotation in 3D space can be determined by 3 quantities:

- **The direction** of the rotation axis, specified by the **polar angle** $\theta$ and the **azimuth angle** $\varphi$ (collectively denoted by $n = (\theta, \varphi)$)

- **The angle of rotation** $\alpha$ around the rotation axis

To obtain the general rotation matrix (denoted by $R_n( \alpha)$), we proceed in the following way:

1. **Change basis so that the rotation axis *coincides* with the $z$-axis**

    We first rotate the old basis $K = \{e_i\}$ by $\theta$ around the old $y$-axis, then rotate around the old $z$-axis by an angle $\varphi$ to get the new basis $K' = \{e'_i\}$. 
    
    This change of basis is described by the matrix

    $$
    \mathcal{D}_n
    = R_z(\varphi) R_y(\theta)
    $$

2. **Rotate the object around the new $z$-axis**

    The new basis $K'$ is still an orthonormal basis, so the three basis rotation matrices $R_i(\alpha) \, (i=x,y,z)$ are not changed. The problem is now reduced to the rotation around the new $z$-axis by an angle $\alpha$, described by

    $$ R_z(\alpha)$$

<center>

![](Figures/rotation_matrix.svg)   
*Two steps to obtain the new basis*

</center>

From the theory of change of basis, the new representation matrix $R_z(\alpha)$ is related to the old one $R_n(\alpha)$ by the similar transformation

$$
R_z(\alpha)
= \mathcal{D}^{-1}_n R_n(\alpha) \mathcal{D}_n
$$

Therefore, the **general 3D rotation matrix** around the axis along direction $n = (\theta,\varphi)$ by angle $\alpha$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
    R_n(\alpha)
    &= \mathcal{D}_n
    R_z(\alpha) \mathcal{D}^{-1}_n
    \\
    &= R_z(\varphi) R_y(\theta) R_z(\alpha)
    R_y^{-1}(\theta) R_z^{-1}(\varphi)
\end{aligned}
$$

### EXERCISE

- Derive the matrices $R_x(\theta), R_y(\theta), R_z(\theta)$.

- Using properties of trigonometric functions, verify that 
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        R_i^{-1}(\alpha) &= R_i(-\alpha) \\
        R_i(\alpha + \beta) &= R_i(\alpha) R_i(\beta)
        \\
        &= R_i(\beta) R_i(\alpha) 
    \end{aligned}
    \qquad i = x,y,z
    $$

    Are these results trivial to you?

- Using geometrical properties of rotation, show that for the general rotation matrix $R_n(\alpha)$:

    - $R_n^\mathsf{T}(\alpha) R_n(\alpha) = 1$ (rotation matrices are **orthogonal matrices**).

        *Remark*: Calculating the inverse of a rotation matrix is now easy: we only need to exchange its columns and rows:

        $$
        R^{-1} = R^\mathsf{T}
        $$

    - $\det R=1$ (With both properties, it will be called a **special** orthogonal matrix).
    
    - $R_n(\alpha)$ only has one real eigenvalue 1 (*Question: what is the corresponding eigenvector?*)

## Angular Velocity

To find the linear velocity of the rotating object at $\boldsymbol{r}(t)$, recall that (assume that the rotation starts at time $t = 0$)

$$
\boldsymbol{r}(t)
= R_n(\alpha (t))
\boldsymbol{r}(0)
\qquad \alpha (0)=0
$$

Now we want to calculate the *instantaneous* linear velocity at time $t_0$:

$$
\boldsymbol{v}(t_0) 
\equiv 
\frac{d\boldsymbol{r}(t_0)}{dt}
= \frac{dR _n(\alpha (t_0))}{dt}
\boldsymbol{r}(0)
$$

We separate the rotation to two steps:

$$
R_n(\alpha(t))
= R_n(\alpha(t)-\alpha(t_0))
R_n(\alpha(t_0))
$$

Then $[\alpha(t)-\alpha(t_0)]_{t=t_0} = 0$, and we now define the **angular velocity matrix**:

$$
\omega(t_0) \equiv \left[
    \frac{dR_n(\alpha(t)-\alpha(t_0))}{dt}
\right]_{t=t_0}
$$

Its matrix elements are

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \omega(t_0)
    &= R_z(\varphi) R_y(\theta) \left[
    \frac{d R_z(\alpha(t)-\alpha(t_0))}{dt}
    \right]_{t=t_0} R_y^{-1}(\theta) R_z^{-1}(\varphi)
    \\
    &= R_z(\varphi) R_y(\theta) \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & -\omega(t_0) & 0 \\
        \omega(t_0) & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 
    \end{bmatrix}
    R_y(-\theta) R_z(-\varphi)
    \\
    &= \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & -\omega _3 & \omega _2 \\
        \omega _3 & 0 & -\omega _1 \\
        -\omega _2 & \omega _1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \omega_1 = \omega_{32} 
    & = \omega(t_0) \sin \theta \cos \varphi 
    \\
    \omega_2 = \omega_{13} 
    & = \omega(t_0) \sin \theta \sin \varphi 
    \\
    \omega_3 = \omega_{21} 
    & = \omega(t_0)  \cos \theta
\end{aligned} \qquad
\omega(t_0) = \frac{d\alpha(t_0)}{dt}
$$

If you are familiar with the spherical polar coordinates, you should immediately recognize that these three elements are exactly the Cartesian components of a *vector* $\boldsymbol{\omega}$. The direction of $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is *parallel to the rotation axis*. We then define the *combination of this three numbers* as the **angular velocity vector**. 

Then the linear velocity $\boldsymbol{v}(t_0)$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \boldsymbol{v}(t_0)
    &= \omega(t_0) R_n(\alpha(t_0)) \boldsymbol{r}(0)
    \\
    &= \omega(t_0) \boldsymbol{r}(t_0)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since this holds for any time $t_0$, we can finally remove the subscript 0 and directly write

$$
\boldsymbol{v}(t) = \omega(t) \boldsymbol{r}(t)
$$

$\omega(t)$ here is the angular velocity *matrix*.

*Remark*: We see that the angular velocity matrix has one notable property

$$
\omega_{i j}=-\omega_{j i}
$$

Such matrices are said to be **anti-symmetric**.


## Cross Product

After we rewrite the matrix $dR/dt$ using the three numbers
$\omega_i (i=1,2,3)$, the linear velocity can be expressed as

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \boldsymbol{v}
    = \omega_{i j} r_j 
    &= \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & -\omega_3 & \omega_2 \\
        \omega_3 & 0 & -\omega_1 \\
        -\omega_2 & \omega_1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
        r_1 \\
        r_2 \\
        r_3
    \end{bmatrix}
    \\
    &= \begin{bmatrix}
        \omega_2 r_3 - \omega_3 r_2 \\
        \omega_3 r_1 - \omega_1 r_3 \\
        \omega_1 r_2 - \omega_2 r_1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

This *defines* the formula of **cross product**:

$$
\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \boldsymbol{r}
= \begin{bmatrix}
    \omega_2 r_3 - \omega_3 r_2 \\
    \omega_3 r_1 - \omega_1 r_3 \\
    \omega_1 r_2 - \omega_2 r_1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### EXERCISE

Please verify that

$$
M = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
    b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\
    c_1 & c_2 & c_3
\end{bmatrix}
\Rightarrow 
\det M = \boldsymbol{a}\cdot (\boldsymbol{b}\times \boldsymbol{c})
$$

## The Angular Velocity is NOT Really a Vector

Now you should know that the angular velocity *matrix* is the more
natural quantity, and the angular velocity *vector* is just some derived
object. But there must be some reason why people treat it as a vector
under most cases.

In fact, under *rotations* of the object, the angular velocity vector
behaves exactly the same as the position vector (which is, *by
definition*, a *true* vector). However, it will betray itself under
*reflections*. Let us see what happens in the latter case.

Consider for simplicity the reflection about the $x z$-plane. The transformation matrix of the position vector is

$$
P_y = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

You should be able to write it down quickly using the meaning of the three columns of the matrix. Its inverse is itself (please verify this by direct calculation).

In the mirror (reflected world), since $\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\boldsymbol{r}$ are both "true" vectors, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &\boldsymbol{r}' = P_y\boldsymbol{r}, \quad
    \boldsymbol{v}' = P_y\boldsymbol{v}
    \\ \\
    &\Rightarrow 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x' \\
        y' \\
        z'
    \end{bmatrix}
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        x \\
        -y \\
        z
    \end{bmatrix}, \quad
    \begin{bmatrix}
        v_x' \\
        v_y' \\
        v_z'
    \end{bmatrix}
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        v_x \\
        -v_y \\
        v_z
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

However, the new $\boldsymbol{\omega}'$ vector must be extracted from the new $\omega'$ matrix, instead of applying $\boldsymbol{\omega}' = P_y\boldsymbol{\omega}$ (wrong). By definition

$$
\boldsymbol{v} = \omega \boldsymbol{r}
\Rightarrow 
\boldsymbol{v}' = \omega' \boldsymbol{r}'
$$

Note that here $\omega$ and $\omega'$ are both angular velocity matrices, not angular speed. Then

$$
P_y\boldsymbol{v}=\omega' P_y\boldsymbol{r}
$$

The left-hand side is again equal to $P_y\omega  \boldsymbol{r}$. Therefore, 

$$
P_y\omega \boldsymbol{r} = \omega'P_y \boldsymbol{r}
$$

Since this is true for *any* position $\boldsymbol{r}$, we obtain the following rule:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    &P_y \omega = \omega' P_y
    \\
    &\Rightarrow  \omega'
    = P_y \omega  P_y^{-1}
    = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & \omega_3 & \omega_2 \\
        -\omega_3 & 0 & \omega_1 \\
        -\omega_2 & -\omega_1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

We remark that $\omega$ and $\omega'$ are related by a similarity transformation. Now we can read off the new angular velocity *vector*:

$$
\boldsymbol{\omega}' 
= \begin{bmatrix}
    -\omega_1 \\
    \omega_2 \\
    -\omega_3
\end{bmatrix}
= - P_y \boldsymbol{\omega}
$$

We find that there is an additional minus sign. You can apply the right-hand rule in a mirror to have a feeling about this minus sign.

In mathematics, objects like the angular velocity vector are called **pseudo-vectors**. You can read the corresponding [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudovector) to learn more about it.

### EXERCISE

Show that the angular velocity vector behaves in the same way as the position vector under rotations. You may need the general rotation matrix we found earlier.
