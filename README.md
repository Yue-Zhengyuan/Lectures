# Lectures

This repository is a collection of lecture notes on physics and related mathematics. The ultimate aim is to make a modern version of "theoretical minimum" like *The Course of Theoretical Physics* for (theoretical) condensed matter physicists. However, I may quit physics anytime.

## Standard of Good Lecture Notes

<center>

**AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE**

</center>

- Assumes no prior knowledge on the part of the readers
- Jokes and anecdotes are strictly forbidden to avoid distraction and reduce file size
- New concepts should be introduced with good motivations
- Key ingredients in a complex derivation should never be omitted, in order to save labor of new generations of learners, unless the derivation is much less important compared to the result itself
- Avoid cross-references that breaks the smoothness and continuity of the reading experience

## Current Contents

None of the following is now complete or has reached my standard.

## File Structure

Files of different formats serve the following purposes:

- Markdown: Theoretical Explanations and derivation. 
    - Equations are typeset using the KaTeX support in Markdown (enabled by, say, the [Markdown All-in-One](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown) extension for Visual Studio Code).
    - Complex formula and figures requiring advanced LaTeX packages are compiled separately, and then inserted to the Markdown files as SVG images.

- Jupyter notebooks and Python sources: Calculation (numerical) projects and illustrations.

- Mathematica notebooks: Assistance to derivation of complex equations and illustrations.

- PowerPoint presentations: Illustrations that are inconvenient to draw by coding. 

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcomed, but your notes should reach the highest standard. I hope I will not get into copyright problems.
