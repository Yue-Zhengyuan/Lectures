# Lectures

This repository is a collection of lecture notes on physics and related mathematics. The ultimate aim is to make a modern version of "theoretical minimum" like *The Course of Theoretical Physics* for (theoretical) condensed matter physicists. However, I may quit physics anytime.

## Standard of Good Lecture Notes

<center>

**AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE**

</center>

- Assumes no prior knowledge on the part of the readers
- Jokes and anecdotes are strictly forbidden to avoid distraction and reduce file size
- New concepts should be introduced with good motivations
- Key ingredients in a complex derivation should never be omitted to save labor of new generations of learners, unless the derivation is much less important compared to the result itself
- Avoid cross-references that breaks the smoothness and continuity of the reading experience

## Current Contents

None of the following is now complete or has reached my standard. 

- **Classical Mechanics**. Based on
    - *Essence of Linear Algebra* by Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown)
    - *Mechanics* by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz
    - Course *PHYS1110 (Engineering Physics: Mechanics)* at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)

- **Statistical Physics and Condensed Matter Physics**. Based on
    - *Statistical Physics (Part 1)* by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz
    - Course *PHYS5430 (Solid State Physics)* at CUHK
    - Course *PHYS5510 (Advanced Statistical Physics)* at CUHK
    - Course *PHYS5520 (Many-Body Theory)* at CUHK
    - Course *Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics II* at Fudan University (FDU)

- **Quantum Field Theory**. Based on
    - *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory* by Michael E. Peskin and Daniel V. Schroeder
    - *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model* by Matthew D. Schwartz
    - *Conformal Field Theory* by Philippe di Francesco, Pierre Mathieu and David Sénéchal
    - Course *Physics 215a (Particles and Fields)* at The University of California, San Diego (UCSD)

- **Conformal Field Theory**. Based on
    - *Conformal Field Theory* by Philippe di Francesco, Pierre Mathieu and David Sénéchal
    - *Introduction to Conformal Field Theory* by Ralph Blumenhagen and Erik Plauschinn

- **Differential Geometry and Gravity**. Based on 
    - *Geometry, Topology and Physics* by Mikio Nakahara
    - *Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell* by Anthony Zee

- **Machine Learning**. Based on
    - Course *Machine Learning (Coursera)* by Andrew Ng

## File Structure

Files of different formats serve the following purposes:

- Markdown: Theoretical Explanations and derivation. 
    - Equations are typeset using the KaTeX support in Markdown (enabled by, say, the [Markdown All-in-One](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown) extension for Visual Studio Code).
    - Complex formula and figures requiring advanced LaTeX packages are compiled separately, and then inserted to the Markdown files as SVG images.

- Jupyter notebooks and Python sources: Calculation (numerical) projects and illustrations.

- Mathematica notebooks: Assistance to derivation of complex equations and illustrations.

- PowerPoint presentations: Illustrations that are inconvenient to draw by coding. 

## Contribution

Contributions to this repository are welcomed, but your notes should reach the highest standard. I hope I will not get into copyright problems.
